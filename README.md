Luggage_concierge is a ruby program that is designed for a hotel concierge to use in assigning a size appropriate locker for each checked luggage. A ticket is generated once a checked luggage is assigned a locker. The ticket number will be used to retrieve the checked luggage from the locker. There are 1000 small, 1000 medium and 1000 large lockers in total. Locker assignment of luggage is based on size of checked luggage and not quantity. Checked luggage is always assigned to smallest available locker it can fit into.
